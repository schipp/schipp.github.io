I'm a PostDoc in seismology working at University of Hamburg. I am interested in the nature of the ambient seismic field and its applications.

My work is currently focused on Matched Field Processing and expanding its applicability. If you're interested, feel free to [contact](mailto:sven.schippkus@uni-hamburg.de) me.

### Research Topics

#### The ambient seismic field

**The ambient seismic field** describes all contributions to the recorded wavefield that are not associated with transient sources such as earthquakes. In recent years, the **ambient seismic field** has become a major discipline within seismology. At low frequencies (<1Hz), ocean waves act as a continuous source and are the dominant contributor to the **ambient seismic field**. These frequencies are now routinely used to image the crustal structure of the Earth, amongst other applications. The processes are generally well understood, although open questions remain in particular around the generation of Love waves.

At higher frequencies (>1Hz), the dominant sources of the **ambient seismic field** are less well-known and depend significantly on the locality. To resolve those frequencies, dense seismic arrays are essential and are increasingly being deployed all around the world, hand-in-hand with the development of ambient seismc field techniques. I'm currently working on an industrial-scale dense array (5k stations) that allows some fascinating insight.

#### The Alps

**The Alps** are the largest orogene in Europe and even though they have been studied extensively over the years, many questions remain open. To answer some of them with seismological methods, the [AlpArray](http://www.alparray.ethz.ch) seismic network has been installed to record continuous seismic data over several years. I have been lucky enough to be able to analyze this data to gain additional insight on the crustal structure and regional stress field in the wider Vienna basin region.
